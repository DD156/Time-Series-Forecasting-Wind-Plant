# Time Series Forecasting on Wind Plants

## Overview

This project focuses on time series forecasting for wind plants. The project encompasses several critical steps in data analysis and model building, including:

- Careful Analysis of Wind Plants
- Detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Outlier Analysis
- Hyperparameter Tuning with Cross-Validation
- Pipeline Creation
- Further Considerations

## Project Steps

### Careful Analysis of Wind Plants
- Conduct an in-depth analysis of the wind plants' data to understand key factors affecting wind energy production.
- Examine various attributes such as wind speed, direction, temperature, and their impact on energy output.

### Detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Perform initial data exploration to uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies in the data.
- Generate visualizations to summarize key insights and data distributions.

### Feature Engineering
- Create and transform features to enhance the predictive capabilities of the model.
- Include relevant features such as temporal variables, lag features, rolling statistics, and more.

### Outlier Analysis
- Identify and handle outliers in the dataset to ensure model accuracy and robustness.
- Use statistical methods and visual inspections to detect and treat outliers.

### Hyperparameter Tuning with Cross-Validation
- Implement cross-validation techniques to assess model performance and ensure it generalizes well to unseen data.
- Use hyperparameter tuning to optimize model parameters and improve prediction accuracy.

### Pipeline Creation
- Develop reusable data processing and model training pipelines for efficient workflow management.
- Ensure that all steps, from data preprocessing to model evaluation, are streamlined and reproducible.

### Further Considerations
- Address any additional considerations that may impact the forecasting model, such as data quality, external factors, and model limitations.
- Explore advanced techniques and methods to further refine the forecasting model.
